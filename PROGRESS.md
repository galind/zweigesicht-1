# Current project status

Updated 3 October 2026. Setup is in the [README](README.md); extended checks are
in [architecture](docs/LOCAL_ARCHITECTURE.md). Repository visibility remains private.

## Current application

- Static CAD explorer: 426 source instances, six mechanism groups, component
  inspection/isolation, separation and fitted case/dial/hand configurations.
- Workshop: 89 Easy placements, or 249 Hard placements and 35 transfers; 16
  foundation leaves remain and both finish with 265. Undo/local saves retained.
- Production hides the homepage Workshop entry and `?assemble=1`; direct
  `/workshop`, `/play` redirect, noindex and sitemap exclusion remain.
- Original contributions use standard MIT; required upstream notices ship with
  builds. Maker CAD/design and derived assets remain outside that grant.

## Publication preparation

`codex/publication-blockers` starts from refreshed `develop` at `90b606e`.
Remote `main` is `0037646`; `codex/running-movement` is `45fa9d3`; no remote tags.
PR #25 is merged. The preparation branch has Vercel Git deployment disabled.
[Draft PR #26](https://github.com/galind/zweigesicht-1/pull/26) targets `develop`;
the verified preparation milestone was committed and pushed over SSH.

- Recorded version hashes and branch reachability for runtime assets, source-linked
  decisions and audit metadata in the [publication inventory](assets/source-manifest/publication-inventory.json).
- Rechecked maker pages; no adequate public redistribution grant is recorded.
  Prepared an [unsent permission request](docs/ASSET_PERMISSION_REQUEST.md).
- [Release gates](docs/RELEASE_GATES.md) contain exact historical findings,
  proposed path removals, author-email treatment, hosted-surface coverage and a
  comparison of coordinated rewriting versus a fresh public snapshot.
- Essential assets, provenance and notices remain intact. No history rewrite,
  remote deletion, visibility change, release, deployment or permission-request sending occurred.
  Ignored local briefs and unrelated work remain untouched.

## Verification

Exposure review: 267 remote commits / 1,680 blobs; 273 local commits / 1,727 blobs;
seven decoded gzip versions; commit messages and email metadata; PR #1–#25
patches/discussions; 20 logs and empty artifact listings from 10 PR-head runs.
No checked credential signatures matched. Coverage gaps are explicit in the gates.

Preparation checks passed: 82 tests, inventory validation, typecheck/lint,
production build, 101 inventory path-version hashes, 22 local Markdown links,
JSON validity, preserved runtime/license/notice bytes and changed-file formatting.
Prior browser checks remain dated evidence; this documentation/configuration
change does not certify physical devices, mechanical behavior or live deployment.

## Decisions before public visibility

1. Obtain maker permission for current and historical derived assets, or approve
   code-only distribution with externally supplied assets and revised setup/CI.
2. Choose a fresh public repository with this original retained private
   (recommended), or authorize a coordinated history rewrite and separate hosted
   cleanup. Decide internal-report retention and author-email privacy.
3. Review and authorize the concrete remediation, then verify the approved result
   before separately authorizing public visibility. Making this original public
   also requires completing the older/push/manual Actions and hosted-content review.

Server-side develop protection and production qualification remain unverified.
Applicable physical-device, accessibility/usability, mechanical and clean-machine
CAD reproduction gates remain outstanding. Merging preparation or releasing
`develop` to `main` does not authorize publication.
